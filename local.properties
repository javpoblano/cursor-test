# This file contains machine-specific paths for your Android SDK.
# You should customize this file with your actual Android SDK path.
# For example:
# sdk.dir=/Users/yourname/Library/Android/sdk
# 
# On Windows, it might look like:
# sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\yourname\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
#
# On Linux, it might look like:
# sdk.dir=/home/yourname/Android/Sdk

# Uncomment and set the correct path for your Android SDK:
# sdk.dir=/path/to/your/android/sdk
